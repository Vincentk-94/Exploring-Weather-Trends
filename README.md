# Exploring Weather Trends - Project
___

In this project I analyse local (London, UK) and global temperature trends. A SQL query has been written to extract London's temperature trends and then exported to CSV. The same has been performed to extract global data. Excel was used to analyse and create visualisations based off the data.

* Open **Exploring Weather Trends.pdf** to view the project.
* The 3 .csv files contain data obtained by running SQL queries.
* **Global Temperatures Graph.xlsx** contains the calculations and graphs.
